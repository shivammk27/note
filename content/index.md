Hey, I am [Shivam](https://shivammk27.github.io/). This is a personal space where I jot down thoughts, observations, and musings on various topics that pique my intellectual curiosity.
My notes are not bound by strict rules of grammar or formatting conventions. Instead, they are raw expressions of my mind, captured in the moment, and presented in their authentic form. Few may be well-structured and polished, while most of them might be incomplete or rough around the edges.

So, let yourself loose, and let the journey begin !
If you are interested to see what I am reading check my [[./readingList.md|reading list]].
