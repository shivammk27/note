To capture value you need to capture X and Y both

### 2. Perfect competition

- irrelevant in a dynamic world
- preempts question of value

### 3. Monopoly

Pros

- incentive to innovate
- stable, long term planning
- deeper project financing
- symptomatic of creation
  <--->
  Cons
- lower output, higher prices
- price discrimination
- stifle innovation

### 4. Lies of people

People in monopoly pretend not to (so that they dont get regulated by the government)
We are in a huge market

People in perfect competition pretend they are doing something unique. Make yourself look less competitive
We are in a narrow market

### 5. How to establish a monopoly

Start small and monopolize (easier to dominate a smaller market than a large one)

### 6. Last mover advantage

proprietary technology
network effects
economies of scale
branding
